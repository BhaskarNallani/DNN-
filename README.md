# DNN and RNN  
    All Machine learning or Deep learning approches falls into one of the category of Supervised, Un-Supervised and Reinforsement learning. 

# Techniques in Machine learning
 # Supervised
   # Clsification
    K-Nearest Neighour,Support Vector Machine,Naive Bayes,Discriment Analysis,
   # Regression
    Decision Trees, Random Forest, Linear/Logistic Regression, Neural Networks,
 # Unsupervised 
    Clustering ( K-Means,Gussian Mixture, Hidden Morkov Models, Neural Networks
   
    PCA - Princple Component Analysis, Normalization (Batch Norm), Regularization are used to arrange the data convert the algorithm faster and acurately.

# Libraries and Optimization
    OpenCV, XGBoost, CuDNN, OpenVINO, OpenCL (GPU/FPGA), CUDA (Nvidia GPU only) , MKL-DNN (Intel) , Intel IPP
    
# Transfer Learning
    Take any pretrained network VGG-16 or ResNet and remove last FC layers and change it to your need. 
    Freeze the other layers aprt form the FC layers added and train.
    Fusion networks take connects featurs maps from different layers to get more accuracy/ derive new features.
